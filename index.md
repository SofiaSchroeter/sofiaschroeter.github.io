Welcome! I'm a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Lausanne under the supervision of [Rafael Lalive](https://sites.google.com/site/rafaellalive/) and [Fabrizio Colella](https://fabriziocolella.com/). 
I hold a Master in International Economics from the Graduate Institute Geneva and a Bachelor in International Relations from the University of Geneva. 
I also successfully completed the Swiss Program for Beginning Doctoral Students in Economics. 

Prior to starting the PhD, I worked as a Research Assistant at ZEW Mannheim, the World Trade Organization and the Swiss National Bank.

My research interests include Labour Economics, Applied Microeconomics and International Trade.

I have visited UC Berkeley from January to May 2025, hosted by Patrick Kline.

You can find my CV [here](/cv/).
